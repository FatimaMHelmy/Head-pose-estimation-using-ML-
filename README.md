## STEPS
## 1: 
## **DISCOVER YOUR PROBLEM FIRST**

Since the face of a person can rotate over all three axis â€” but with some limitations, of course.  **We want to detect theses movments Using ML MODEL**. We call these movements the Euler Angles (Roll, Pitch, and Yaw)..|| forMathematical explanation Check this article >>[Real-Time Head Pose Estimation With OpenCV and Dlib](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/real-time-head-pose-estimation-with-opencv-and-dlib-e8dc10d62078)
