# **DISCOVER YOUR PROBLEM FIRST**

Since the face of a person can rotate over all three axis â€” but with some limitations, of course.  **We want to detect theses movments Using ML model**. We call these movements the Euler Angles (Roll, Pitch, and Yaw)..

## Why Machine Learning :

In normal cases, we can solve the head pose problem mathmatically if we have **3D landmarks** [check this article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/real-time-head-pose-estimation-with-opencv-and-dlib-e8dc10d62078), but in our problem we have only **2D landmarks** so the mathmatical solution is fired here.>>  check these sources

# Dataset preparation
**we are using [AFLW2000](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/aflw2000-3d)**

You need the 2D (x,y) locations of face landmarks. I used two approches 

1: using the points which determine the face ( the tip of the nose, the chin, the left corner of the left eye, the right corner of the right eye, the left corner of the mouth, and the right corner of the mouth).

2: using all face landmarks which extracted by mediapie, they are 465 points.

### I found that the features of first approach weren't enough and gave me low accuracy so I used second one.

# MODEL SELECTION
Now we have created our dataset, we just have to pick a machine-learning algorithm to classify the poses. In this step, we will take an image, run the face mesh model (that we used earlier for creating the dataset) to get the key points of the person present in that image, and run our model on that test case. The model is expected to give the correct results with a high confidence score. I am going to use several REGRESSION models from the sklearn library then choose the best one to perform the **Regression task**.
